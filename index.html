    <h2>What Does the Tool Do?</h2>
    <p>
        The Piano Fingering Assignment Tool analyzes the notes in a piano piece and assigns optimal fingerings to each note. It considers factors such as hand size, finger strength, and the physical layout of the piano keyboard to recommend fingerings that:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimize Hand Movement</strong>: Reducing unnecessary shifts and stretches.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhance Playing Comfort</strong>: Adapting to your specific hand size for a natural feel.</li>
        <li><strong>Improve Technical Efficiency</strong>: Allowing smoother transitions between notes and chords.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advanced Fingering Algorithm</strong>: Utilizes sophisticated techniques inspired by professional pianists to determine the most efficient fingerings.</li>
        <li><strong>Hand Size Customization</strong>: Offers options from extra small (XXS) to extra large (XXL) hand sizes to tailor the fingerings to your individual needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Easy-to-Use Interface</strong>: Simple drag-and-drop functionality for uploading your music files and downloading the updated versions with fingerings included.</li>
        <li><strong>No Installation Required</strong>: Runs entirely in your web browser, so there's no need for additional software.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Upload Your Music File</strong>: Drag and drop your piano piece (in JSON format) into the tool.</li>
        <li><strong>Select Your Hand Size</strong>: Choose from XXS to XXL to ensure the fingerings are comfortable for you.</li>
        <li><strong>Process the File</strong>: The tool analyzes the piece using the advanced algorithm.</li>
        <li><strong>Download the Updated File</strong>: Get your music file back with the recommended fingerings added to each note.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice with Confidence</strong>: Use the fingered music to practice more effectively, focusing on technique and expression.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Who Can Benefit?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pianists of All Levels</strong>: From beginners learning proper technique to advanced players refining their skills.</li>
        <li><strong>Music Educators</strong>: Provide students with fingerings that are suited to their hand sizes and technical abilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Self-Learners</strong>: Enhance your practice sessions by using professional fingering suggestions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Proper Fingering Matters</h2>
    <p>
        Using the correct fingers when playing piano is crucial for several reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical Proficiency</strong>: Proper fingering enables smoother transitions and more accurate playing.</li>
        <li><strong>Comfort and Ergonomics</strong>: Reduces strain and the risk of injury by promoting natural hand movements.</li>
